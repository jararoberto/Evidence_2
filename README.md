Evidence 2 | Decision Support Analysis

I liked the class, but it cost me a bit, problems and topics related to programming have been a problem for me, but with this class I am now a little more informed about linear regression, its importance, and its applications. The teacher explained very well, he was always there to help us and answer our questions, he was a very flexible and good teacher, and I loved taking this subject with him. This class will help me a lot in my working life, I plan to have a small company and I would like to be able to use the linear regression to predict scenarios, analyze data and improve as a company, without a doubt I appreciate being able to take this class with a great teacher.
